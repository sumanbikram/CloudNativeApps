## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

Before initiating the hands-on lab, you will setup an environment to use for the rest of the exercises.

### Task 1: Download GitHub resources

1. Open a browser window to the Cloud Workshop GitHub repository (<https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Modern-cloud-apps>).

2. Select **Clone or download**, then select **Download Zip**.

    ![Download Zip from Github repository.](images/Setup/2019-06-24-17-08-18.png)

3. Extract the zip file to your local machine, be sure to keep note of where you have extracted the files. You should now see a set of folders:

    ![Windows Explorer showing the extracted files.](images/Setup/2019-06-24-17-10-56.png)

### Task 2: Deploy resources to Azure

1. Click the following **Deploy to Azure** button to deploy the ARM Template with the resources for this lab. This link will deep link into the Azure Portal, passing in the ARM Template for deploying the resources for this lab.

    [![Deploy to Azure](images/azure-deploy-button-small.png "Deploy to Azure")](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fcrpietschmann%2FMCW-Modern-cloud-apps%2Fmaster%2FHands-on%20lab%2Fscripts%2Ftemplate.json)

    >**Note:** If you have issues with the **Deploy to Azure** link, then do a new **Custom deployment** in the Azure Portal using the `/Hands-on lab/scripts/template.json' ARM Template within the lab files.

2. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Create new** for the **Resource group** field, and enter `ContosoSports-[your initials or first name]`.

3. Select **Edit parameters**

    ![Select Edit Parameters.](images/Setup/2019-06-24-17-17-05.png)

4. On the **Edit parameters** pane, select the **Load file** button.

5. Locate and open the **\Hands-on lab\Scripts\parameters.json** file within the extracted files.

6. Select **Save**.

7. Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.

8. Select **Purchase**.

    ![Select Purchase.](images/Setup/2019-06-24-17-20-12.png)

9. The deployment will take 15-30 minutes to complete. To view the progress, select the **Deployments** link, then select the **Microsoft.Template** deployment.

    ![View template deployment status.](images/Setup/2019-06-24-17-22-19.png "Resource group deployments")

10. **Note**: A configuration script to install SSMS and the requires lab files will run after the deployment of the LabVM completes. The task will be listed on the deployment progress screen as `LabVM/CustomScriptExtension`. You should wait for this task to complete before attempting to log into the LabVM in the next task, as it downloads and installs files you will need.

    - **Admin username**: `demouser`
    - **Admin password**: `demo@pass123`

2. Open the `C:\MCW` folder.
